# Figure Skating Jumps Word Guess Game
The Figure Skating Jumps Word Guess Game challenges players to interact by using their keyboard to input English language keys in an effort to correctly guess the word presented in blank lines on screen. Each alphabetic key press should be recorded once in the "Letters Already Guessed" portion of the page, regardless of that letter also being shown in the word or not. Only instances where a selected key is not present in the world will decrease the player's remaining guesses. On "Game Over," players will be presented with a new word to select keys for. 

There is no end to the game, and no real way to lose, though there is code within the game tracking losses.

This project was coded using no extra JavaScript libraries. This was an is an exellent learning exercise, from coming to understand the use of Set() keeping repeat keys from being pressed to coming face to face with variables locked away due to Scope issues. Having tried tackling this concept from three different code layout approaches, I found various modules and snippets translated across all my attempts, while others had to be overhauled to make sense while tracking both for when a variable was empty, when it was changed, and how often it was modified (if at all).

This is all part of a homework assignment for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020).
